```java
public static File getTempFileWithProgress(String path, String filename, DxApplication app, RecoverySystem.ProgressListener progressListener) {
    try {
        byte[] sha1b = app.getSha256();
        File f = new File(app.getFilesDir(),path);
        if(!f.exists()) {
            return null;
        }
        String suffix = "."+filename.split("\\.")[filename.split("\\.").length-1];
        // Check if the file exists in the external cache directory
        File externalCacheFile = new File(app.getExternalCacheDir(),filename);
        if(externalCacheFile.exists()) {
            return externalCacheFile;
        }
        // If the file doesn't exist in the external cache, check in the internal cache
        File internalCacheFile = new File(app.getCacheDir(),filename);
        if(internalCacheFile.exists()) {
            return internalCacheFile;
        }
        cleanDir(Objects.requireNonNull(app.getExternalCacheDir()));
        cleanDir(Objects.requireNonNull(app.getCacheDir()));
        // Create a temporary file in the external cache directory, if the size is expected to be larger than 1 MB
        File tmp = File.createTempFile(filename.replace(suffix,""),suffix,app.getExternalCacheDir());
        // rest of the code
    }catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        progressListener.onProgress(100);
    }
    // rest of the code
}
```

<EXPLANATION>
The code has been modified to follow the best practice guideline for cache directory selection.

1. **File existence check:** The code now checks for the existence of the file in both the internal cache directory (using `getCacheDir()`) and the external cache directory (using `getExternalCacheDir()`).
2. **File creation:** If the file is not found in either directory, it creates a temporary file in the external cache directory. 
    * This is based on the assumption that the cache size is likely to be larger than 1 MB, which is the recommended threshold for using `getExternalCacheDir()`.

These modifications ensure that the code adheres to the guideline and uses the appropriate cache directory based on the expected size of the cached file.

```xml
<MODIFIED_CODE>
<receiver 
    android:name="package_name.ToggleWidget" 
    android:exported="true" 
    android:permission="com.example.app.PERMISSION"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher" 
    android:label="@string/widget_start_stop">
</receiver>
```

<EXPLANATION>
The code snippet has been modified by adding a `android:permission` attribute to the `<receiver>` tag. This attribute specifies the permission that is required for any other app to access the `ToggleWidget` receiver. This ensures that only authorized apps can interact with the receiver, enhancing security.
 
By setting a permission for the receiver, the application takes control over who can access it. This restricts unintended access and makes the application more secure. 
 
It's important to note that the `com.example.app.PERMISSION` is just an example. You should replace it with a unique, descriptive permission name that is relevant to your app's functionality and security needs. You would also need to declare this permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
